						<h2>Get online week&hellip; 18 &mdash; 25 October 2020</h2>
						<div>
						<p>This year, WorthingDigital along with <a href="https://onestopjunction.org.uk">OneStop Junction</a>, <a href="https://worthingandadurchamber.co.uk">Worthing & Adur Chamber of Commerce</a> and <a href="https://www.cityfibre.com">CityFibre</a> are taking part in <a href="https://uk.getonlineweek.com">Get online week</a></p>
						<p>Established in 2007, National Get Online Week exists to improve lives through digital and is a week-long annual celebration with thousands of events happening across the UK. In 2018 Good Things Foundation, whose vision is a world where everyone benefits from digital, joined the campaign and have been delivering it ever since. This year’s theme is “Now’s the time to get online” and we’re supporting the campaign by running a series of online learning events throughout the week.</p>
